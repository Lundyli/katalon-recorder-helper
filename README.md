Due to limitations in JavaScript and browsers' API, there are some actions that cannot be done by Katalon Recorder alone. In these cases, Katalon Recorder will send commands to a CLI tool named Katalon Recorder Helper to finish the actions.

Katalon Recorder Helper is an open source project. It is actually a very lightweight Java server that listens for commands from Katalon Recorder. It is built on top of the Spring Boot framework.

Please see the usage here https://docs.katalon.com/x/PQTR.
